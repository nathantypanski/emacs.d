;; Narrowing means focusing in on some portion of the buffer, making
;; the rest temporarily inaccessible. The portion which you can still
;; get to is called the accessible portion. Canceling the narrowing,
;; which makes the entire buffer once again accessible, is called
;; widening. The bounds of narrowing in effect in a buffer are called
;; the buffer's restriction.
